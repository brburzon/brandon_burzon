Hi there!


This is my first post, so I hope that you welcome me as a new blogger. 
In this blog, I plan to document my journey, experience, and new things
I learn as I develop new skills as a programmer. 


I hope that you find this useful especially for those of you who are
just starting a career as a software engineer. 


Let's all learn together!


Thanks,
Brandon B.
