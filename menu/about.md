Hi there!

My name is Brandon Burzon, and I work as a software developer engineer for Amazon Inc in Seattle, WA. If you have ever shopped online, then you probably have heard of us!

Anyways, back to my story. 

When I am not coding, then I am probably spending time with my family. I enjoy hiking with my fiance, going to the parks, walking on the beach, and exploring new places to see. I have a dog named Poopie (why? because I like it), and a cat named Scootie. 

Now, how did I get here?

Unlike what you might be thinking, you don’t have to be an expert at X with 100+ years of experience to work as a programmer for a big 4 tech company. 

I am 23 years old with no graduate school background who finished school with a 2.6 GPA. Also, I didn’t have to go to a top university in order to make six figures today. 

In this blog, my ultimate goal is to share my journey and document the things I learn along the way. I hope you find this blog useful and convince you that you can do it too!

PS: All of the content I share are based on my opinion, and does not represent my employer.

Thanks, and happy reading!
